# Description

I was making a robot game in java, and I needed to use an AI but most of them are paid.
So I'm going to try to make a neural network totally free and I'm not interested in receiving recognition.
I put a creative commons license, I don't know if I have to do anything else.
In terms of name I had thought of Leibniz as the mathematician, but leibnix sounds more computer-oriented.
I do it in spring java maven api rest because that's what I know.
